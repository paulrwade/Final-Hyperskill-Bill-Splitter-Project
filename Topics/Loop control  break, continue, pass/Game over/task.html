<h2>Game over</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p>In online test games, there is usually a limited number of lives: if, for example, you make 3 mistakes, you lose, and cannot continue with the game. Let's try to implement this system.</p>
<p>Read the line with user answers from the input<strong>: C </strong>for a correct answer and <strong> I </strong>for an incorrect one, separated by space. Then count the number of correct answers (this number is the final score) before a user has reached the limit of wrong answers, equal to <strong>3</strong>. They lose after their third mistake. If they make no more than 2 mistakes, they win. If a user loses the game, print "<strong>Game over" </strong>and their score. If the user wins, print <strong>"You won" </strong>and their score. The message should be printed without quotation marks. The message and the score should be printed on separate lines.</p>
<p><strong>The input format:</strong></p>
<p>A line with <strong>N</strong> user answers in a game separated by space</p>
<p><strong>The output format:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Game over </strong>or <strong>You won</strong><br/>
